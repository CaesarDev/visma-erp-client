$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\ShipmentApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$shipment_nbr = 'shipment_nbr_example'; // string | Identifies the Shipment to update
$shipment_update_dto = new \OpenAPI\Client\Model\ShipmentUpdateDto(); // \OpenAPI\Client\Model\ShipmentUpdateDto | Defines the data for the Shipment to update
$erp_api_background = 'erp_api_background_example'; // string | Accepts the request and queues it to be executed in the background by our least busy worker. Responds with 202 Accepted and a document containing a JobId reference and details state location. Supported values: * a URL: when the background operation is finished, a notification will be posted to the URL with a document containing a reference id, status code and a details state location. * \"none\" (without quotes): Fire and forget; no notification will be sent when background operation is finished. * \"subscription[:<name_1>=<value_1>,..,<name_n>=<value_n>]\" (without quotes): when the background operation is finsihed, a notification is posted to the Webhook subscription set up in Developer Portal for your integration client.
